            <h2>As a programmer..</h2>
            <p>I enjoy my work so far in front end, which is what I have all of my experience with so far.  Creating basic web pages with HTML CSS utilizing open libraries such as Bootstrap and Materialize has been a lot of fun, especially when I get to collaborate with other people.  I also speak a modicum of Javascript, mostly straight JS as I'm not cool enough to use Angular or OOJS very well yet.</p>

            <h2>As a person..</h2>
            <p>I like hanging out at home watching TV or playing video games with one of my 2 cats on my lap, as they keep me warm and the constant purring helps to quell my rage when losing a game in Overwatch.  I also enjoy being active though, hiking and snowboarding are my seasonal pastimes, but my regular activity is lifting weights, which I've been doing for a few years now.  I also like playing board games with my girlfriend and my friends when we have them over while binge watching some random sci-fi show in the background.</p>

              <p>My latest project where we had to clone the Wikipedia front page of the day, in 4 hours, using Bootstrap and a lot of our own styling.</p>

              <p>This was the last page I created using pure CSS and HTML, and I was just rather proud of the color scheme and how it can resize well.</p>

              <p>The first page I had to make with Bootstrap.  The color scheme is something I sampled but thoroughly enjoyed so I wanted to include it in my portfolio to prove that I can still have good taste while being somewhat colorblind.</p>

              <p>This is the functioning page of a personal project of mine that I created with 5 other people at a Hackathon 4 weeks before starting at Epicodus.  The idea is that you can click on a muscle group, and when you do, you'll be lead to a page where you may select a workout for said muscle group.  The entire app was nearly fully functioning, including some backend and database workings.</p>
