              <p>I enjoy my work so far in front end, which is what I have all of my experience with so far.  Creating basic web pages with HTML CSS utilizing open libraries such as Bootstrap and Materialize has been a lot of fun, especially when I get to collaborate with other people.  I also speak a modicum of Javascript, mostly straight JS as I'm not cool enough to use Angular or OOJS very well yet.  I am a college graduate with an Associates from Bellevue College in computer systems and networking, and after graduating college <span>I became the Junior IT Administrator of the company Datstat Inc.</span> for a little over a year, at which point my field of choice turned to development.  I studied independantly mostly focusing on the front end for a few months, using <a href="http://freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp.com</a> as my guide, nearly completing their front end certification.  I decided though that my ability to teach myself code was peaking, and that taking this course at epicodus where I could learn a lot about backend as well as fine tune my front end skills would be extremely beneficial.  I also relished the opportunity to network and nab a free internship.</p>

              <p>I like hanging out at home watching TV or playing video games with one of my 2 cats on my lap, as they keep me warm and the constant purring helps to quell my rage when losing a game in Overwatch.  I also enjoy being active though, hiking and snowboarding are my seasonal pastimes, but my regular activity is lifting weights, which I've been doing for a few years now.  I also like playing board games with my girlfriend and my friends when we have them over while binge watching some random sci-fi show in the background.  My nerdier hobby is mechanical keyboard collecting; basically I build keyboards with specific switches, modify them, redesign and resell them, or hold on to them and use them forever.  Currently my favorite board to use is my Leopold fc660c with 45g Topre switches, which I used to code this page right here.  </p>

              <p>My most recent project at Epicodus was re-creating the days <em>Wikipedia home page</em>.  It was done using <strong>HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</strong> </p>

              </a>
              <p>This was the last project I made before adding Bootstrap to my CSS usage.  I was particularly happy with the colorscheme because it was red themed and the page is for the band <em>Maroon 5</em>.  <strong>Get it?</strong>  It uses <strong>HTML, and CSS</strong></p>

              <p>The first page I had to make with Bootstrap.  The color scheme is something I sampled but thoroughly enjoyed so I wanted to include it in my portfolio to prove that I can still have good taste while being somewhat colorblind.</p>

              <p>This is the functioning page of a personal project of mine that I created with 5 other people at a Hackathon 4 weeks before starting at Epicodus.  The idea is that you can click on a muscle group, and when you do, you'll be lead to a page where you may select a workout for said muscle group.  The entire app was nearly fully functioning, including some backend and database workings.</p>
