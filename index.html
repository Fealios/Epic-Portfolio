            <h2>As a programmer..</h2>
            <p>I enjoy my work so far in front end, which is what I have all of my experience with so far.  Creating basic web pages with HTML CSS utilizing open libraries such as Bootstrap and Materialize has been a lot of fun, especially when I get to collaborate with other people.  I also speak a modicum of Javascript, mostly straight JS as I'm not cool enough to use Angular or OOJS very well yet.</p>

            <h2>As a person..</h2>
            <p>I like hanging out at home watching TV or playing video games with one of my 2 cats on my lap, as they keep me warm and the constant purring helps to quell my rage when losing a game in Overwatch.  I also enjoy being active though, hiking and snowboarding are my seasonal pastimes, but my regular activity is lifting weights, which I've been doing for a few years now.  I also like playing board games with my girlfriend and my friends when we have them over while binge watching some random sci-fi show in the background.</p>
